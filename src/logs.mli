(** Logging.

    [Logs] provides a basic logging infrastructure. {{!func}Logging}
    is performed on {{!Src}sources} whose reporting
    {{!type:level}level} can be set independently. Log message
    report is decoupled from logging and handled by a
    {{!reporters}reporter}.

    See the {{!basics}basics} and a few {{!usage}usage conventions} to
    respect.

(** {1:level_and_sources Reporting levels and sources} *)

(** The type for reporting levels. For level semantics see the
    {{!usage}usage conventions}.

    Logging sources have an optional {{!Src.level}reporting level}. If
    the level is [Some l] then any message whose level is smaller or
    equal to [l] is reported. If the level is [None] no message is
    ever reported. *)

end

type 'a msgf = (?header:string -> ?tags:Tag.set -> 'a) -> unit
(** The type for message formatting functions.

    Message formatting functions are called with a message
    construction function whenever a message needs to be reported. The
    message formatting function must call the given message
    construction function with the arguments of the message. The
    arguments of the message are defined by the format string of the
    log function see {!log} for examples. The optional arguments of the message
    construction function are:
    {ul
    {- [header], an optional printable message header. Default to [None].}
    {- [tags], a set of tags to attach to the message. Defaults
       {!Tag.empty}.}} *)

val unit_msgf : ?header:string -> ?tags:Tag.set -> unit -> unit msgf
(** [unit_msgf ?header ?tags ()] is [(fun m -> m ?header ?tags)]. *)

val unit : unit msgf
(** [unit] is {!unit_msgf}[ ()]. *)

type 'a log = ('a, Format.formatter, unit) format -> 'a msgf -> unit
(** The type for log functions.

    For minimizing the overhead whenever the message is not reported,
    message formatting only occurs on actual message report via the
    {{!msgf}message formatting function}. This leads to the following
    logging structure:
{[
Logs.err "invalid key value pair (%a,%a)"
  (fun m -> m pp_key key pp_val value);
]}
    The pattern is quite simple: it is as if you were formatting as
    usual except you need to interpose the function with the [m]
    argument standing for the format string. If your format string has no
    directives, the type system will annoy you with the formatting function
    because of the optional arguments. You have to write:
{[
Logs.err "You are doomed!" (fun m -> m ?header:None ?tags:None);
]}
    To avoid this [Logs] provides the constant formatter {!Logs.unit}
    so that you can simply write:
{[
Logs.err "You are doomed!" Logs.unit;
]} *)

val msg : ?src:src -> level -> 'a log
(** [msg ?src l fmt (fun m -> m ...)] logs with level [l] on the source

(** The type for reporters.

    A reporter formats and handles log messages that get
    reported. Whenever a {{!func}log function} gets called on a source
    with a level equal or smaller to the {{!Src.level}source's reporting
    level}, the {{!reporter}current reporter}'s field [r.report]
    gets called as [r.report src level k fmt msgf]
    where:
    {ul
    {- [src] is the logging source.}
    {- [level] is the reporting level.}
    {- [k] is the function to invoke to return.}
    {- [fmt] is the message format string.}

(** [set_reporter r] sets the current reporter to [r]. *)

(** {1:monitoring Logs monitoring} *)

val err_count : unit -> int
(** [err_count ()] is the number of messages logged with level [Error]
    across all sources. *)

val warn_count : unit -> int
(** [warn_count ()] is the number of messages logged with level
    [Warning] across all sources. *)

(** {1:basics Basics}

    If you are writing an application you must remember to
    {{!set_reporter}set} the reporter before any logging operation
    takes place otherwise no messages will be reported. For example if
    you are using the {{!Logs_stdo}standard outputs reporter}, logging
    can be setup as follows:
{[
let main () =
  Logs.set_reporter (Logs_stdo.reporter ());
  ...
  exit (if Logs.err_count > 0 then 1 else 0);
  ()
]}
    If you have logging code that is performed in the toplevel
    initialization code of modules (not a good idea) or you depend on
    (bad) libraries that do so, you must call and link the reporter
    install code before these initialization bits are being
    executed otherwise you will miss these messages.

    The documentation of {!Logs_cli} module has a {{!Logs_cli.ex}full setup
    example} that includes command line options to control color and log
    reporting level.

    The basics for using the logging functions is explained
    {{!log}here}. Note that log messages hit the reporter and
    are formatted only if they have not been filtered out by the current
    {{!Src.level}reporting level} of the source you log on.

    If you are writing a library you should neither install reporters, nor
    set the reporting level of sources, nor log on the {!default} source or
    at the [App] level; follow the {{!usage}the usage conventions}. A
    library should simply log on an another existing source or define
    its own source like in the example below:
{[
let src = Logs.Src.create "mylib.network" ~doc:"logs mylib's network events"
module Log = (val Logs.src_log src : Logs.LOG)
]}
    The [Log] module defines logging functions that are specific to the
    source [src].

    {1:usage Usage conventions}

    A library should never log on the {!default} source or at the
    [App] level these are reserved for use by the application. It
    should either create a source for itself or log on the source
    defined by one of its dependencies. It should also never set the
    reporting level of the sources it deals with or install reporters since
    control over this must be left to the application.

    The semantics of {{!type:level}reporting levels} should be understood
    as follows:
    {ul
    {- [App], this level can be used for the standard output or console
       of an application. It should never be used by libraries.}
    {- [Error], error condition that prevent the program from
       running normally.}
    {- [Warning], suspicious condition that does not prevent the
       program from running normally but may eventually lead to an
       error condition.}
    {- [Info], condition that allows the program {e user} to get a better
       understanding of what the program is doing.}
    {- [Debug], condition that allows the program {e developer} to get a
       better undersanding of what the program is doing.}} *)
