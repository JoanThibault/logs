(** Logging.

    [Logs] provides a basic logging infrastructure. {{!func}Logging}
    is performed on {{!srcs}sources} whose reporting
    {{!type:level}level} can be set independently. Log message
    report is decoupled from logging and handled by a
    {{!reporters}reporter}.

    See the {{!basics}basics}, a few {{!usage}usage conventions} to
    respect and a note on {{!sync}synchronous logging}.

(** {1:basics Basics}

    {2:logging Logging}

    In order to minimize the overhead whenever a log message is not reported,
    message formatting only occurs on actual message report via the
    {{!msgf}message formatting function} you provide to log functions. This
    leads to the following logging structure:
{[
let k, v = ... in
Logs.err (fun m -> m "invalid kv (%a,%a)" pp_key k pp_val v);
Logs.err (fun m -> m "NO CARRIER");
]}
    The pattern is quite simple: it is as if you were formatting with
    a [printf]-like function except you get this function in the [m]
    argument of the function you give to the logging function.

    If you want to abstract a repeated log report it is better to keep
    the message formatting function structure for the arguments of the
    messages. Here's how the above examples can be abstracted and
    invoked:
{[
let err_invalid_kv args =
  Logs.err @@ fun m ->
  args (fun k v -> m "invalid kv (%a,%a)" pp_key k pp_val v)

let err_no_carrier args =
  Logs.err @@ fun m -> args (m "NO CARRIER")

let () =
  err_invalid_kv @@ fun args -> args "key" "value";
  err_no_carrier @@ fun () -> ();
  ()
]}
    Note that log messages are formatted and hit the reporter only if
    they have not been filtered out by the current
    {{!Src.level}reporting level} of the source you log on. See also
    the log source and reporting level {{!usage}usage conventions}.

    {2:setupreporter Reporter setup}

    If you are writing an application you must remember to
    {{!set_reporter}set} the reporter before any logging operation
    takes place otherwise no messages will be reported. For example if
    you are using the {{!Logs_fmt}formatter reporter}, logging
    can be setup as follows:
{[
let main () =
  Logs.set_reporter (Logs_fmt.reporter ());
  ...
  exit (if Logs.err_count > 0 then 1 else 0);
  ()
]}
    If you have logging code that is performed in the toplevel
    initialization code of modules (not a good idea) or you depend on
    (bad) libraries that do so, you must call and link the reporter
    install code before these initialization bits are being executed
    otherwise you will miss these messages.

    The documentation of {!Logs_cli} module has a {{!Logs_cli.ex}full setup
    example} that includes command line options to control color and log
    reporting level.

    If you are writing a library you should neither install reporters, nor
    set the reporting level of sources, nor log on the {!default} source or
    at the [App] level; follow the {{!usage}the usage conventions}. A
    library should simply log on an another existing source or define
    its own source like in the example below:
{[
let src = Logs.Src.create "mylib.network" ~doc:"logs mylib's network events"
module Log = (val Logs.src_log src : Logs.LOG)
]}
    The [Log] module defines logging functions that are specific to the
    source [src].

    {1:usage Usage conventions}

    A library should never log on the {!default} source or at the
    [App] level these are reserved for use by the application. It
    should either create a source for itself or log on the source
    defined by one of its dependencies. It should also never set the
    reporting level of the sources it deals with or install reporters since
    control over this must be left to the application.

    The semantics of {{!type:level}reporting levels} should be understood
    as follows:
    {ul
    {- [App], this level can be used for the standard output or console
       of an application. It should never be used by libraries.}
    {- [Error], error condition that prevent the program from
       running normally.}
    {- [Warning], suspicious condition that does not prevent the
       program from running normally but may eventually lead to an
       error condition.}
    {- [Info], condition that allows the program {e user} to get a better
       understanding of what the program is doing.}
    {- [Debug], condition that allows the program {e developer} to get a
       better undersanding of what the program is doing.}}

    {1:sync Note on synchronous logging}

    In synchronous logging, a client call to a log function proceeds
    only once the reporter has finished the logging operation. In
    [Logs] this depends on both the reporter and the client.

    The client gives to the reporter a continuation that defines the
    result type of the log function and a callback to be called whenever
    the log operation is over (see {!kmsg}). The later can be invoked
    before or after the continuation and can be used to unblock
    the continuation, this is what is done for example

    For example if the {!Logs_fmt.reporter} is used with formatters
    that write to channels all log functions will be synchronous
    and block until either the report is discarded or the formatted
    message has been written to the channel.

    However this the latter reporter is problematic in an cooperative
    concurency setting like {!Lwt}, since it will block the whole runtime
    system. In the latter case the log functions of {!Logs_lwt} can be
    used.



    {1:ex1 Example with custom reporter and tags}

    This example uses a {{!Tag}tag} to attach {!Mtime} time spans in
    log messages. The custom reporter uses these time spans to format
    relative timings for runs of a given function. Note that as done
    below the timings do include logging time.
{[
let stamp_tag : Mtime.span Logs.Tag.def =
  Logs.Tag.def "stamp" ~doc:"Relative monotonic time stamp" Mtime.pp_span

let stamp c = Logs.Tag.(empty |> add stamp_tag (Mtime.count c))

let run () =
  let rec wait n = if n = 0 then () else wait (n - 1) in
  let c = Mtime.counter () in
  Logs.info (fun m -> m "Starting run");
  let delay1, delay2, delay3 = 10_000, 20_000, 40_000 in
  Logs.info (fun m -> m "Start action 1 (%d)." delay1 ~tags:(stamp c));
  wait delay1;
  Logs.info (fun m -> m "Start action 2 (%d)." delay2 ~tags:(stamp c));
  wait delay2;
  Logs.info (fun m -> m "Start action 3 (%d)." delay3 ~tags:(stamp c));
  wait delay3;
  Logs.info (fun m -> m "Done." ?header:None ~tags:(stamp c));
  ()

let reporter ppf =
  let report src level ~over k msgf =
    let k _ = over (); k () in
    let with_stamp h tags k ppf fmt =
      let stamp = match tags with
      | None -> None
      | Some tags -> Logs.Tag.find stamp_tag tags
      in
      let dt = match stamp with None -> 0. | Some s -> (Mtime.to_us s) in
      Format.kfprintf k ppf ("%a[%0+04.0fus] @[" ^^ fmt ^^ "@]@.") dt
        Logs.pp_header (level, h) dt
    in
    msgf @@ fun ?header ?tags fmt -> with_stamp header tags k ppf fmt
  in
  { Logs.report = report }

let main () =
  Logs.set_reporter (reporter (Format.std_formatter));
  Logs.set_level (Some Logs.Info);
